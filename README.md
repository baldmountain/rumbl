# Rumbl

This is the Rumbl example from the book Programming Phoenix. It has been
updated to use Phoenix 1.2 and Elixir 1.3. The only difference is that is uses
MySql rather than Postgesql.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
